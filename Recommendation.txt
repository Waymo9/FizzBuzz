Story point estimation: 8 Story Points: This reflects a moderate level of complexity and effort due to the need for both development
and configuration tasks as well as some necessary research or learning for those less familiar with Ruby, RSpec, or GitHub Actions

Recommendations for improvement:
- Create a more detailed README that includes usage examples, installation instructions, and troubleshooting tips.
- Create a file explaining the process that the candidate went through when working on this User Story
- The current user story mentions setting up a pipeline but does not specify which types or stages of pipelines are needed (e.g., CI vs. CD).
    Specify whether the pipeline should only run tests, handle deployments, or both.
- Include specific code quality standards that should be met, such as test coverage percentages or adherence to a style guide.
- While the story mentions unit tests, it could be beneficial to specify types of testing further.
